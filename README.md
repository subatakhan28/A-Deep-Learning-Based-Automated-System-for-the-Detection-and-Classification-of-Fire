The risk of potential fires in closed systems like warehouses is excruciatingly high. Moreover, the lack of workers actively present in the vicinity ensures the need of an automated system that could detect and prevent fire outrages. The currently installed fire alarm systems in warehouses have a wide margin of error. Most warehouses cannot monitor heat and temperature 24/7 and neither can a business afford a long-term staff just for the fire hazard. Hence, to prevent any major losses this system will be installed. The real-time data collected on the hardware nodes will be processed to derive the root cause of the fire. This will be depicted in the shape of the 5 classes of fire: Class A, B, C, D, or K. Each class has a distinguishing feature depending on the material that is subject to the fire. This classification of fire is done through a trained convolutional neural network. This, along with the amount of smoke spread, will be displayed on a user-friendly web application, with alerts about the fire. This is how early detection of fire will prevent major damages from occurring.
